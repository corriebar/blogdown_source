    "# House-Cleaning: Getting rid of outliers (Part 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with real-world data presents many challenges that sanitized text book data doesn't have. One of them is how to handle outlier. Outliers are defined as points that differ significantly from other data points and they are especially common in data obtained through manual input processes.  <br>\n",
    "For example, on an online listing site, someone might accidentally pressed the zero-key a bit too often and suddenly the small rental flat is as expensive as a palace. While it is obvious in this example that the recorded data does not represent the real world, other outliers can be more tricky. What is for example with the old villa in a small town offered for 1€? It might be one of these run-down houses in a dying town and thus could be the actual offering price.\n",
    "\n",
    "Very roughly we can say that there are two categories of outliers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outliers that don't represent a real observation, but instead result from an error or mistake. I'll call them \"proper outlier\".\n",
    "- Outliers that do represent a real observation, but look extremely different compared to other data. I'll call them \"improper outlier\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding which type of outlier one is dealing with can be difficult and one usually needs to check the context. Ideally, you'll only want to discard \"proper outliers\" and keep the improper ones. However, both types of outlier can be problematic for any subsequent analysis or modelling. In this post, I will mostly focus on identifying outliers in general and won't talk too much about distinguishing between the two. Nevertheless, I highly recommend you to always check what type of outlier you're dealing with and to determine the cause of the outlier.\n",
    "But now let's talk about how to identify outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A year ago, I [scraped](/2018/scraping-the-web-or-how-to-find-a-flat) some [rental offers](https://www.kaggle.com/corrieaar/apartment-rental-offers-in-germany) and except for throwing away some duplicates, this is still very much the raw data and thus still has a bunch of outliers.\n"
