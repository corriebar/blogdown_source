    "# House-Cleaning: Getting rid of outliers (Part 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the [previous post](/2020/outlier-handling-one), we tried to clean rental offerings from some outliers. We first just had a look at our data and tried to clean by simply using threshold derived from our own knowledge about flats with minor success. We got slightly better results by using the IQR rule and learned two things: First, the IQR rule works better if our data is normally distributed and, if it's not, transforming it works wonders. The second learning was that picking a threshold for each variable (either by hand or through the IQR rule) doesn't work well if our variables are strongly correlated. The IQR rule always forms a rectangular threshold-window over our data where we would be better served with an elliptical window for correlated data. And what math object has an elliptical shape? Right, a multivariate Gaussian."

The grey lines give the rectangular threshold as obtained from the IQR rule (using a factor of 1.5). There are quite a few points at the lower left that would be classified as outlier by the IQR rule but whose likelihood is mostly still above the log-likelihood threshold we picked. In the upper right corner, the two methods mostly agree on what classifies as an outlier but the IQR rule misses the one manually added outlier in the lower right corner. Obviously, I added this particular outlier because it highlights how a multivariate outlier detector can find outliers that arise from a correlation between two variables. Neither the $x$ nor the $y$ value of this  point is very unusual, only the combination makes it an outlier. \n",

However, you might easily be unlucky with the random sample you got, either finding way too many or too little outliers. Thus, instead of just sampling and fitting once, I repeatedly sample and fit. Each time fitting on a small sample, predicting on the whole data, and finally compute the relative frequency of how often a point was classified as outlier. This way, I also get a probability how likely a point is to be an outlier! Neat!\n",

    "A nice thing about the Gaussian mixture outlier detection method is, that it can easily be extended to more than two columns. In this data set for example there are two more variables that also commonly have input errors: the number of rooms and the construction year.\n",
    "For the construction year, we have different options to use it in our model: either use as is or use the log transformed age of a building. Unfortunately, both ways have disadvantages: If we use the construction year as is, we will detect many very old houses as outliers and even though buildings from the middle age are rare, Germany has quite a few cities with many very old buildings. If instead we use the log transformed age, we miss many outliers: there are for example suspiciously many buildings constructed in 1111. For these kind of outliers, we would need a different approach. \n",
    "For this analysis, I used the log transformed age and also log transformed the number of rooms. The later helps in identifying cases where the number of rooms is too high for the amount of living space. As a high number of observations also do not have a construction year, I will do this part only on a subset.\n"

There definitely are quite a few real offers in this data built aroud the 10th century but most flats built in 1111 were probably just people being lazy when inputting the construction year."
