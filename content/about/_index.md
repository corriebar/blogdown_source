Hey there, I am Corrie and this is my blog. I am a Data Scientist and these are my musings about a range of topics, somehow all related to Data. 


As a trained Mathematician, I put great focus on understanding the methods I apply. This not only means, that I want to understand the theory behind a certain algorithm but also that I strive to understand why an algorithm outputs a certain result. 
This has lead me to study Bayesian Statistics, a combination of interesting theory and philosophy, as well as a framework to model and explain your data. Sampling is an important concept in Bayesian Statistic which lead me to the name of this blog, though I hope to also share thoughts about other topics that I find interesting. 

Closely linked to a wish to understand the data, I find it just as important to effectively communicate analysis results. Afterall, what use is an analysis if people don't understand it and can't act on the results. I found data visualizations a good way to make data and its use accessible to a wide audience. You can find some of my data visualizations [here](../tags/data-viz) and [here](https://github.com/corriebar/TidyTuesday).

Topics I'm interested in:

- Bayesian Statistics
- Network Analysis
- Data Visualization
- Data Communication
- Application of Data Science methods 
  - e.g. to topics such as disinformation
- Topological Data Analysis
- Machine Learning
- Data Culture


In my freetime, I enjoy reading a good book, growing tomatoes on my balcony and a good cup of tea or coffee.
