Hey there, I am Corrie and this is my blog. I am currently working as a Data Scientist and these are my musings about a range of topics, somehow all related to Data. 
My motivation to share these are manifold: By writing things down, I hope to get a better and deeper understanding myself. This provides a reference for future-me to look up and maybe someone else might also find some posts helpful.

As a Mathematician by training, I've always put a gread focus on understanding the methods I apply. This not only means, that I want to understand the theory behind a certain algorithm but also that I strive to understand why an algorithm outputs a certain result. This has lead me to self-study Bayesian Statistics, a combination of interesting theory and philosophy, as well as a framework to model and explain your data. Sampling is an important concept in Bayesian Statistic which leads to the name of this blog, though I hope to also share thoughts about other topics that I find interesting. 
Closely linked to a wish to understand my data, I find it just as important to be able to communicate my results and am a big fan of pretty data visualizations.
Other topics you might find here are the odd data wrangling trick, handy data tools, new (or old-fashioned) machine learning methods, useful R or python packages, and maybe even a bit about topological data analysis.
