      <description>I recently stumbled across this data set about visa costs. It is a collection of visa costs for all countries for different kind of visas (tourist, business, work, transit, and some other visas). Each row corresponds to visa relations between a source country (the country applying for the visa) and a target country (the country issuing the visa) together with the cost for the different visa types.
Since I had a bit of free time on my hand, I decided to do some “plotcrastinating”, play around with the data and try out some new visualizations.</description>

      <description>I recently participated in a hackathon organised by EU’s anti-disinformation task force where they gave us access to their data base. The data base consists of all disinformation cases the group has collected since it started in 2015. Their data can also be browsed online on their web page www.euvsdisinfo.eu. The data contains more than 7000 cases of disinformation, mostly news articles and videos, that were collected and debunked by the EUvsDisinfo project.</description>
