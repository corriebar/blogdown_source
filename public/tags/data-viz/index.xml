      <description>I recently stumbled across this data set about visa costs. It is a collection of visa costs for all countries for different kind of visas (tourist, business, work, transit, and some other visas). Each row corresponds to visa relations between a source country (the country applying for the visa) and a target country (the country issuing the visa) together with the cost for the different visa types.
Since I had a bit of free time on my hand, I decided to do some “plotcrastinating”, play around with the data and try out some new visualizations.</description>
