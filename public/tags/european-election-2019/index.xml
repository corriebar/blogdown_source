      <description>The European Election is coming up and for the first time I have the impression this election is actually talked about and might have an impact. I donâ€™t remember people caring that much about European Elections in the years before, but this of course could also just be because I got more interested in European politics. Unfortunately, European politics are complex and this is also mirrored in the quantity of parties that are up for vote in Germany.</description>
