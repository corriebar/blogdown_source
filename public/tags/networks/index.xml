      <description>I recently participated in a Hackathon organised by EUâ€™s anti-disinformation task force where they gave us access to their data base. The data base consists of all disinformation cases the group has collected since it started in 2015 and they can also be browsed online on their web page: www.euvsdisinfo.eu. I built a small R package that makes it easier to download the data from their API (it seems though as if the API is currently not updated as regularly as their web page).</description>
