      <description>In the last two years, I pretty much only went to very techie conferences, such as the PyData Berlin, the PyCon or the SatRday. They&amp;rsquo;re all great conferences, organized by awesome people and I will definitely go again but this fall I decided to try out a new conference and check out the Predictive Analytics World in Berlin. First, because it&amp;rsquo;s alsways good to try out new things and also because in the last months I became more aware of how important is to keep a business focus, which frankly isn&amp;rsquo;t mentioned much in Python talks about how to deploy machine learning models.</description>
